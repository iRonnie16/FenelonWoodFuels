    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <hr class="underline">
    <p class="aboutpara">Fenelon Wood Fuels is a leading supplier of high quality hardwood fuel
	in the midlands and south-east. We're a relatively new business dedicated to providing the highest
	quality service and products at the best value. Our business is based just ten minutes outside of
	Athy Co. Kildare. We guarantee that our naturally seasoned firewood is of the highest standard. Our
	timber is tested before sale to ensure it is all at most 20% moisture content or below. This 
	ensures clean, easy burning with maximum heat output. Our timber is dry stored and kept completely
	clean of inorganic residue to ensure minimum ash is produced when burning. We cater to both wholesale and retail customers with delivery services provided.
	We also sell in bulk to customers who come to the yard with a trailer, van, lorry etc. to fill
	with loose firewood. We cut and split all our firewood to standard dimensions so that they fit in
	a full range of stoves and fireplaces. Special orders can always be catered for so please do not
	hesitate to contact us with any queries and we will satisfy your needs or requirements as best we can. </p>
